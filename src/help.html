  <h4 class="red-text text-lighten-2">Application Overview</h5>
  <p>The NGVS Search tool has three main components:</p>
  <ul class="collection">
    <a class="collection-item" href="#map-help">Map Pane</a>
    <a class="collection-item" href="#sidebar-help">Sidebar</a>
    <a class="collection-item" href="#overlay-pane-help">Overlay Pane</a>
  </ul>

<section id="map-help">
  <h4 class="red-text text-lighten-2">Map Pane</h4>
  <p>The Map pane contains an interactive </p>
</section>

<section id="sidebar-help">
  <h4 class="red-text text-lighten-2">Sidebar</h4>
  <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Location Search</h5>
  <p>Location Search uses the <a href="http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/cadc-target-resolver/" target="_blank">
    CADC target name resolver</a> to plot the location of one or more objects as markers on the map. 
    Multiple markers can be plotted simultaneously by separating object names by spaces.</p>
  <p>Comma separated RA/Dec pairs in either decimal or HMS/DMS format is also supported.</p>
  <p>To remove search markers submit an empty search.</p>
  
  <blockquote>Example. Add three markers to map: <code>m84 12:30:01, 12:01:04 m87</code></blockquote>
  
  <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Query Catalogs</h5>
  <p>The Query Catalog section can be used to plot objects from various catalogs in the map pane.
    Catalog information can also be downloaded in csv format. To apply a catalog query on the map, 
    select the catalog from the drop-down menu and click apply. Note that very large catalogs may slow
    down the browser. It is reccomended to <a href="#query-refine-help">refine queries</a> in these cases.
    To download the catalog queries in csv format, click the download button.
  </p>
  <h6 id="query-refine-help" class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Refining queries</h6>
  <p>After selecting a catalog, a list of various parameters are displayed that can be used to refine
    the objects that are displayed on the map (or included in the download). 
  </p>

  <p>Numerical ranges are entered by separating the lower limit from the upper limit separated by two periods.</p>
  <blockquote>Example. Restrict the query to RA values between 187 and 188: <code>"187..188"</code></blockquote> 

  <p>Single inequalities are entered by using the operator followed by the value. 
  </p>

  
  <blockquote>Example. Restrict the query to class_spec values of 3 and above: <code>>= 3</code> or <code>> 2</code>.</blockquote>

  <p>Equalities are entered by entering the value alone.</p>
  <blockquote>Example. Restrict query to objects with a nucleus of 1: <code>1</code></blockquote> 

  <p>Multiple refinements for each parameter can be added by separating the refinements by commas.</p>
  <blockquote>Example. Multiple RA restrictions: <code>187..188, >= 190</code></blockquote> 

  <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">FITS Images</h5>
    <p>All of the available FITS images for a region can be listed my holding shift while clicking and dragging
      a box around the desired region in the <a href="#map-pane-help">map pane</a>. Alternatively all FITS
      images available in the current map pane view can be listed by clicking "List Images In Current Map View".
    </p>
  <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Adjust Map</h5>
  <p>The Adjust Map section contains sliders that can adjust the display of background tiles in the map pane.
    This can be used to enhance visibility of objects or markers.</p>

</section>

<section id="overlay-pane-help">
  <h4 class="red-text text-lighten-2
  
  
  
  
  
  F">Overlay Pane</h4>
  <p>The overlay pane is located in the top right section of the map pane. It contains groups of checkboxed
    that are used to toggle the visibility of various map overlays.
  </p>
  <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Base Maps</h5>
  <p>The Base Map section toggles the background images on the map. By default the map shows NGVS images where
   available with SDSS images covering the rest of the map. Adjustments to the background images can be made
  using the <a href="#adjust-map-help">adjust map</a> tab in the <a href="#sidebar-help">sidebar.</a></p>
  <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Pointings</h5>
  <p>The pointings section displays the name and outlines of the NGVS pointings. Note that any
    <a href="#field-outlines-help">field outline</a> overlays will render on top of the NGVS pointing outlines.
  </p>
  <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Field Outlines</h5>
  <p>The field outline sections display the outlines where FITS images are available for each filter.
    There are separate sections for long and short exposures. Outlines where stacked images are available
    are shown as bold solid lines. Outlines where single images are available are shown as dotted lines.
  </p>
  <p>The field outlines are applied in the order that the checkboxes are toggled. In the case where two
    outlines are overlapping, the one that was most recently toggled on the map will be displayed.
  </p>
  <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Queries</h5>
  <p>The query section is used to quickly toggle visibility of any <a href="#query-help">catalog queries</a>
  that have been applied on the map. By default the map has no queries applied, and the section will
  not be visible.</p>
