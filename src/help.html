<h4 class="red-text text-lighten-2">Application Overview</h5>
  <p>The NGVS Search tool has five main components:</p>
  <ul class="collection">
    <a class="collection-item" href="#map-help">Map Pane</a>
    <a class="collection-item" href="#sidebar-help">Sidebar</a>
    <a class="collection-item" href="#overlay-pane-help">Overlay Pane</a>
    <a class="collection-item" href="#object-popup-help">Object Detail Popup</a>
    <a class="collection-item" href="#fits-popup-help">FITS Image Popup</a>
  </ul>
  
  <section id="map-help">
    <h4 class="red-text text-lighten-2">Map Pane</h4>
    <p>The Map pane contains an interactive map that displays the layers selected in the 
      <a href="#overlay-pane-help">overlay pane</a>. To pan around the map use the arrow keys. To zoom
      use the scroll wheel or the controls in the upper left corner of the pane. The position of the mouse
      cursor is displayed in the bottom-right corner of the pane. To view available FITS images for a region
      on the map. Hold Shift to click and drag a selection box over the desired region.
    </p>

  </section>
  
  <section id="sidebar-help">
    <h4 class="red-text text-lighten-2">Sidebar</h4>
    <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Location Search</h5>
    <p>Location Search uses the <a href="http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/cadc-target-resolver/" target="_blank">
      CADC target name resolver</a> to plot the location of one or more objects as markers on the map. 
      Multiple markers can be plotted simultaneously by separating object names by spaces.</p>
    <p>Comma separated RA/Dec pairs in either decimal or HMS/DMS format is also supported.</p>
    <p>To remove search markers submit an empty search.</p>
    
    <blockquote>Example. Add three markers to map: <code>m84 12:30:01, 12:01:04 m87</code></blockquote>
    
    <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1" id="query-help">Query Catalogs</h5>
    <p>The Query Catalog section can be used to plot objects from various catalogs in the map pane.
      Catalog information can also be downloaded in csv format. To apply a catalog query on the map, 
      select the catalog from the drop-down menu and click apply. Note that very large catalogs may slow
      down the browser. It is reccomended to <a href="#query-refine-help">refine queries</a> in these cases.
      To download the catalog queries in csv format, click the download button.
    </p>
    <h6 class="teal-text text-darken-2">Available Catalogs</h6>
    <p>The following catalogues can be displayed, queried and downloaded:</p>
    <ul class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item">cfht.ngvsCatalog: all certain, likely and probable galaxies belonging to the Virgo cluster</li>
      <li class="collection-item">cfht.ngvsGCXDCatalog: Globular Clusters belonging to Virgo</li>
      <li class="collection-item">cfht.ngvsStarsXDCatalog: foreground stars</li>
    </ul>
      
      
    <h6 class="teal-text text-darken-2" id="query-refine-help" >Refining Queries</h6>
    <p>After selecting a catalog, a list of various parameters are displayed that can be used to refine
      the objects that are displayed on the map (or included in the download). 
    </p>
  
    <p>Numerical ranges are entered by separating the lower limit from the upper limit separated by two periods.</p>
    <blockquote>Example. Restrict the queryin spit to RA values between 187 and 188: <code>"187..188"</code></blockquote> 
  
    <p>Single inequalities are entered by using the operator followed by the value. 
    </p>
  
    
    <blockquote>Example. Restrict the query to class_spec values of 3 and above: <code>>= 3</code> or <code>> 2</code>.</blockquote>
  
    <p>Equalities are entered by entering the value alone.</p>
    <blockquote>Example. Restrict query to objects with a nucleus of 1: <code>1</code></blockquote> 
  
    <p>Multiple refinements for each parameter can be added by separating the refinements by commas.</p>
    <blockquote>Example. Multiple RA restrictions: <code>187..188, >= 190</code></blockquote> 
  
    <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">FITS Images</h5>
      <p>All of the available FITS images for a region can be listed my holding shift while clicking and dragging
        a box around the desired region in the <a href="#map-pane-help">map pane</a>. Alternatively all FITS
        images available in the current map pane view can be listed by clicking "List Images In Current Map View".
      </p>
    <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Adjust Map</h5>
    <p>The Adjust Map section contains sliders that can adjust the display of background tiles in the map pane.
      This can be used to enhance visibility of objects or markers.</p>
  
  </section>
  
  <section id="overlay-pane-help">
    <h4 class="red-text text-lighten-2">Overlay Pane</h4>
    <p>The overlay pane is located in the top right section of the map pane. It contains groups of checkboxed
      that are used to toggle the visibility of various map overlays.
    </p>
    <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Base Maps</h5>
    <p>The Base Map section toggles the background images on the map. By default the map shows NGVS images where
     available with SDSS images covering the rest of the map. Adjustments to the background images can be made
    using the <a href="#adjust-map-help">adjust map</a> tab in the <a href="#sidebar-help">sidebar.</a></p>
    <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Pointings</h5>
    <p>The pointings section displays the name and outlines of the NGVS pointings. Note that any
      <a href="#field-outlines-help">field outline</a> overlays will render on top of the NGVS pointing outlines.
    </p>
    <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Field Outlines</h5>
    <p>The field outline sections display the outlines where FITS images are available for each filter.
      There are separate sections for long and short exposures. Outlines where stacked images are available
      are shown as bold solid lines. Outlines where single images are available are shown as dotted lines.
    </p>
    <p>The field outlines are applied in the order that the checkboxes are toggled. In the case where two
      outlines are overlapping, the one that was most recently toggled on the map will be displayed.
    </p>
    <h5 class="teal-text text-lighten-1">Queries</h5>
    <p>The query section is used to quickly toggle visibility of any <a href="#query-help">catalog queries</a>
    that have been applied on the map. By default the map has no queries applied, and the section will
    not be visible.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="object-popup-help">
    <h4 class="red-text text-lighten-2">Object Detail Popup</h4>
    <p>The object detail popup displays information about individual objects. It can be accesed by clicking
      on the marker icon for an object that is displayed in the map pane. The popup displays a table with 
      all information about the object.
    </p>
  
    <p>For objects in the cfht.ngvsCatalog, the popup also contains links to related downloads for that object.</p>

  <section id="fits-popup-help">
    <h4 class="red-text text-lighten-2">FITS Image Popup</h4>
    <p>The FITS Image popup displays a list of fits images available for a given region in the plane of the sky.
      It can be accessed by holding shift and clicking to drag a box around the desired region. Alternatively it
      can be accessed by using the button in the FITS Images tab in the <a href="#sidebar-help">sidebar</a>. 
    </p>
  
    <p>The popup includes checkboxes that can be used to refine the image selection. A preview of the entire selection
      is shown in a table, with links available for the individual files. The entire selection can be downloaded by 
      clicking the "download selection button". This displays the CADC download manager page for the given selection.
      Instructions for the download manager are shown on this page.
